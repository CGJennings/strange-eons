#
# This file matches human-readable labels with
# shapes that can be used to make markers.
# Labels that begin with '@' will be looked up
# as UI strings (without the '@') to localize the
# name. The value assigned to each label (the part
# after the '=') identifies a resource file that
# defines the silhouette shape. These are greyscale
# images: black pixels are part of the shape and
# white pixels are outside of the shape. (Grey
# pixels will be proportionally translucent.)
# The images should be created at a resolution
# of 150 dots (pixels) per inch.
#
# Package the new shape images in an extension
# along with this file and an extension script
# that calls:
#
#     GameData.parseSilhouettes( "this-file.silhouettes" );
#
