## Application Window

# Like other buttons and labels, you can place an ampersand (&) in front of
# a letter and that letter will be used as the mnemonic key for that item.
# In addition, you can add a pipe (|) and a key stroke description after
# a label in order to specify the keyboard accelerator for the item.
# This will typically take the form:
#    [menu] [shift] [ctrl] [meta] [alt] keyface
# where words in square brackets are optional modifier keys, and keyface is
# the name of the key to be pressed. For example: "ctrl shift U" or "ctrl F12".
# Normally, the modifier "menu" should be used: this will be converted to the
# correct "menu accelertor" key for the platform (Ctrl for *nix/Windows, or
# Command for Macs).
#
# Finally, some commands should have a different label when running on a Mac.
# For example, the command "Exit" on Windows is normally "Quit" on a Mac.
# You can specify an alternative label (or the same label but a different
# accelerator key) by adding a copy of the key with "-mac" appended. For the above
# example, app-exit would read "Exit" while app-exit-mac would read "Quit".

    <b>Unlock.</b> Then delete it and drag a new tile into place from the \
    <b>Tiles</b> tab. Depending on where you place it, you may need to rotate \
    or flip the tile to orient it properly.\n\n\

# New Plug-in Task and Wizard Strings
prj-l-plugin-wiz = New Plug-in Task
prj-l-plugin-wiz-kit = Choose the plug-in type that best matches your goals:

#   standard plug-in type page strings:
prj-l-plugin-wiz-choose-type = Choose the kind of plug-in to create:
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-0 = Activated Plug-in
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-1 = Injected Plug-in
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-2 = Extension Plug-in
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-3 = Theme Plug-in
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-4 = Library Bundle
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-desc-0 = Activated plug-ins are used to add \
  new, tool-like commands. Activated plug-ins are listed in the \
  <b>Toolbox</b> menu, and are run each time the user selects the item.
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-desc-1 = Injected plug-ins are typically used to extend existing \
  features of the application with new capabilities. Examples include new project \
  actions, new project file types and editors, and new export containers. Injected \
  plug-ins are used when a feature can be registered and unregistered without \
  relaunching the application.
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-desc-2 = Extension plug-ins are used to extend the game \
  database. The game database includes the list of available games, expansions, \
  game component types, token silhouettes, and deck tiles. These are features that \
  can only be added when the application is starting.<p>Unlike activated or injected \
  plug-ins, extension plug-ins are loaded when the application starts and are not \
  unloaded until the application shuts down.
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-desc-3 = Theme plug-ins add a new theme, or "skin". Themes \
  are used to customize the application's look and feel.
prj-l-plugin-wiz-type-desc-4 = Libraries contain resources and code that can be used \
  by the application or by other plug-ins. For example, the spelling dictionaries \
  used by the spelling checking system are stored in a library. (If this library is \
  missing, then spelling checking will be disabled but the application will still \
  run.) Libraries are not technically plug-ins, but they are stored in plug-in \
  bundle files and loaded by the plug-in system.

# standard code format page strings:
prj-l-plugin-wiz-choose-code-format = Choose whether the plug-in will be scripted or compiled:
prj-l-plugin-wiz-code-0 = Scripted
prj-l-plugin-wiz-code-1 = Compiled
prj-l-plugin-wiz-code-desc-0 = <b>Scripted plug-ins</b> are written using \
  JavaScript, the same language used to make Web pages interactive. Most plug-ins \
  are scripted. They are quick to write and test. Since the plug-in bundle will \
  include the full source code for the plug-in, scripted plug-ins can be readily \
  borrowed from or expanded upon by others.<p><b>If you are unsure which type to \
  choose, choose scripted.</b>
prj-l-plugin-wiz-code-desc-1 = <b>Compiled plug-ins</b> are written using \
  Java classes, which must be compiled to byte code before they can be included \
  in a plug-in bundle. Compiled plug-ins run faster than scripted plug-ins, and \
  can be developed using powerful third-party development tools if desired. \
  Compiled plug-ins may take longer to write, but they generally have fewer bugs \
  because the compilation process checks for many common kinds of errors.
prj-l-plugin-wiz-code-jdk-warn = <html>No JDK was detected. You will need to<br>\
  install a JDK in order to compile Java classes.
