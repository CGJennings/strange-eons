/**
 * Array.from( arrayLikeObject ) [static]
 * Create a JavaScript <tt>Array</tt> object from any "array-like" object,
 * including a Java array. An array-like object <tt>a</tt> includes a length property
 * and a sequence of zero or more sequential properties <tt>a[0]</tt>,
 * <tt>a[1]</tt>, <tt>a[2]</tt>, ... <tt>a[ a.length-1 ]</tt>.
 *
 * returns an <tt>Array</tt> containing a copy of the elements of <tt>arrayLikeObject</tt>

/**
 * Function.prototype.subclass( superConstructor )
 *
 * Makes objects created with the calling constructor a "subclass" of
 * the <tt>superConstructor</tt> by chaining
 * <tt>constructor.prototype</tt> to <tt>superConstructor.prototype</tt>.
 *
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * <pre>
 * function Super() {
 *     this.x = "super";
 * }
 *
 * Super.prototype.getX = function getX() {
 *     return this.x;
 * }

 * Sub.subclass( Super );

 * var subobj = new Sub();
 * // this will use the getX function defined for Super
 * // (i.e. Super.prototype.getX)
 * println( subobj.getX() );
 * </pre>

 * constructor : the name of the subclass constructor function
 * superConstructor : the name of the superclass constructor function

/**
 * Function.abstractMethod() [static]
 * When called, prints a standard warning message if script warnings are enabled.
 * This function is not meant to be called directly. Rather, this function is
 * assigned to a property in an object's prototype to make that function
 * abstract. When a subclassing object fails to override the abstract method,
 * calls to the abstract method will thus display a warning message for the
 * developer.

/**
 * Number.prototype.toInt()
 * Converts this number to a Java <tt>Integer</tt> object.
 * Any fractional part is discarded. If the number lies outside the
 * range of possible <tt>Integer</tt> values, an exception is thrown.
 *
 * returns this number as a <tt>java.lang.Integer</tt>
 */

/**
 * Number.prototype.toLong()
 * Converts this number to a Java <tt>Long</tt> object.
 * Any fractional part is discarded. If the number lies outside the
 * range of possible <tt>Long</tt> values, an exception is thrown.
 *
 * returns this number as a <tt>java.lang.Long</tt>

/**
 * Number.prototype.toFloat()
 * Converts this number to a Java <tt>Float</tt> object.
 * If the number lies outside the range of possible <tt>Float</tt> values,

/**
 * String.prototype.trim()
 * Removes leading and trailing whitespace from this string.

 * returns this string with whitespace removed from both ends

/**
 * String.prototype.replaceAll( pattern, replacement )
 * Replaces every occurrence of <tt>pattern</tt> with <tt>replacement</tt>,
 * where both values are plain strings rather than regular expressions.
 * The replacements are made as if by processing the string from left
 * to right and replacing each time a match is possible. For example,
 * the following code results in <tt>bb</tt> rather than <tt>bbb</tt>:
 * <pre>
 * println( "aaaa".replaceAll( "aa", "b" ) );

 * pattern : the substring to replace all occurrences of

/**
 * String.prototype.startsWith( pattern )
 * Returns <tt>true</tt> if <tt>pattern</tt> is a prefix of this string.
 * <pre>
 * "meta".startsWith( "me" ); // true

 * </pre>
 *
 * pattern : the string to match against the start of this string
 *
 * returns <tt>true</tt> if and only if this string starts with <tt>pattern</tt>

/**
 * Object.prototype.dontEnum( methodNames... )
 * Prevents the named methods from being enumerated. This is most useful when
 * extending <tt>Object</tt>'s prototype with new functions, as it maintains
 * the ability to use plain objects as a map.
 * <pre>
 * var obj = {};
 * Object.prototype.blight = function blight() {};
 * println( "Before:" );
 * for( let i in obj ) println(i);

/**
 * RegExp.quote( string ) [static]
 * Escapes the characters in a string that have special meaning in a regular
 * expression. If a regular expression is created from the string, it will
 * match <tt>string</tt> literally. For example, <tt>*</tt> would be replaced
 * with <tt>\\*</tt> because <tt>*</tt> has special meaning in a regular
 * expression.

 * string : the string to escape
 *
 * returns a string that encodes <tt>string</tt> as regular expression

/**
 * RegExp.quoteReplacement( string ) [static]
 * Escapes the characters in a string that have special meaning when used as
