/**
 * create( diy )
 * This function is called when the component is first created
 * (before the <tt>DIY</tt> constructor returns).
 * The function serves two basic purposes. First, it must set the DIY's
 * basic configuration properties (number of sheets,
 * the base image to use for the card, and so on).
 * Second, it must set default values for all of
 * the properties that the user will be able to edit later
 * (like Name, Gender, Speed&mdash;whatever is appropriate for the card).
 *
 * The following are the basic configuration properties for
 * a <tt>DIY</tt> component. These properties can only be set inside of the
 * DIY's <tt>create()</tt> function (or inside of its <tt>onRead()</tt>):
 *
 * <div class='indent'>
 * <b>DIY.verison</b> (default <tt>1</tt>)<br>
 * Sets the version of this component type that is created by this script.
 * See <tt>onRead</tt> for a description of how a new version of an extension
 * can be made backwards compatible. Note that this is property is an integer
 * value. If you assign a value like "1.2" it will be silently rounded down.
 *
 * <b>DIY.extensionName</b> (default <tt>null</tt>)<br>
 * If set, this will be displayed to the user as part of the error message
 * if the script file cannot be found. If a user opens a component for which
 * the script file is not present, this allows Strange Eons to direct them
 * to the extension they need to install in order to open the file.
 *
 * <b>DIY.faceStyle</b> (default: <tt>FaceStyle.PLAIN_BACK</tt>)<br>
 * This controls the number and type of faces (sides) that the component provides.
 * The following values are possible:
 *
 * FaceStyle.ONE_FACE : The component has only one face.
 * FaceStyle.PLAIN_BACK : The component has a front face and a plain back face ...
 *     (a fixed image that is drawn automatically).
 * FaceStyle.SHARED_FACE : The component has two faces, but they are identical.
 * FaceStyle.TWO_FACES : The component has two different faces.
 * FaceStyle.CARD_AND_MARKER : The component has three faces (four in practice); ...
 *     the first two faces are typically the front and back of a card, while the ...
 *     third is one side of a marker (with identical obverse side). If the component ...
 *     has a portrait key set (see below), then the card and marker will share a ...
 *     potrait. This is most commonly used for character cards with matching ...
 *     character markers.
 * FaceStyle.FOUR_FACES : The component has four faces; for example, two closely ...
 *     related cards or a folding panel.
 *
 * If the style is set to <tt>ONE_FACE</tt> or <tt>SHARED_FACE</tt>, then any
 * properties that pertain to the card's back face (such as <tt>backTemplateKey</tt>)
 * will be ignored and <tt>paintBack()</tt> will never be called. If the style is
 * set to <tt>PLAIN_BACK</tt>, then the <tt>backTemplateKey</tt> should point to
 * an image resource for the back of the card. In this case again, <tt>paintBack()</tt>
 * will not be called (the card back will be created automatically from the image
 * resource). If the style is set to anything other than <tt>CARD_AND_MARKER</tt>,
 * then attempting to change or read any property associated with the market
 * will typically throw an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
 *
 * <b>DIY.frontTemplateKey</b> (default: <tt>diy-front-sheet</tt>)<br>
 * This is the base name for a group of settings keys that describe the template
 * image for the front face of the component. The template image determines the
 * size of the component and is normally painted on the face to provide the
 * component's background. The following keys can be defined, but only the
 * first is required (where <tt><i>xxx</i></tt> is the base name provided by
 * <tt>frontTemplateKey</tt>):
 *
 * <i>xxx</i>-template : The resource file that contains the image.
 * <i>xxx</i>-ppi : If present, the resolution of the template image in ...
 *     pixels per inch (2.54cm) (default is <tt>150</tt>).
 * <i>xxx</i>-expsym-region : If present, the region where the expansion ...
 *     symbol is drawn (default is no expansion symbol). (It is also possible ...
 *     to add additional keys to position specific expansions.)
 * <i>xxx</i>-expsym-invert : The index of the expansion symbol variant to use ...
 *     by default (the default is index 0).
 * <i>xxx</i>-upsample : A factor to multiply the resolution by for previews ...
 *     (default is <tt>1.0</tt>; usually only changed when a component ...
 *     has very small text, about 6 points or less)
 *
 * The template image for a face can be drawn in its respective paint function
 * (<tt>paintFront</tt> or <tt>paintBack</tt>) by calling
 * <tt>sheet.paintTemplateImage( g )</tt>.
 *
 * <b>DIY.backTemplateKey</b> (default: <tt>diy-front-sheet</tt>)<br>
 * This property works the same as <tt>frontTemplateKey</tt>, but it controls
 * the template image for the back face rather than the front. The property
 * is ignored if the face style is <tt>FaceStyle.ONE_FACE</tt> or
 * <tt>FaceStyle.SHARED_FACE</tt>.
 *
 * <b>Note</b><br>
 * For faces after the first two, you must set the key using the
 * <tt>setTemplateKey( index, templateKey )</tt> function, which allows you to
 * set any face's template by its index. The properties <tt>frontTemplateKey</tt>
 * and <tt>backTemplateKey</tt> are just shorthand for setting the faces with
 * indices 0 and 1, respectively. For example, to set the template key for
 * the marker in a <tt>CARD_AND_MARKER</tt> component, you would use an index
 * of 2.
 *
 * <b>DIY.portraitKey</b> (default: <tt>null</tt>)<br>
 * If this is not <tt>null</tt>, then the card has a portrait image and the
 * editor will provide a tab for editing the portrait settings. The value is
 * the base name of a setting key. To use a portrait, the following settings
 * must also be defined (where <tt><i>xxx</i></tt> is the base name provided by
 * <tt>portraitKey</tt>):
 *
 * <i>xxx</i>-portrait-template : The resource file that contains the ...
 *     default portrait image.
 * <i>xxx</i>-portrait-clip-region : The region where the portrait ...
 *     will be drawn on the card.
 *
 * In addition, the following settings are optional. If they are not present, then
 * the portrait will default to a pan of (0,0) and the scale will be determined
 * automatically using the size of the portrait image and the clip region.
 *
 * <i>xxx</i>-portrait-scale : The scale setting for the default portrait ...
 *     image (where 1 = 100%).
 * <i>xxx</i>-portrait-panx : The number of units by which the default ...
 *     image is shifted horizontally (usually 0).
 * <i>xxx</i>-portrait-pany : The number of units by which the default ...
 *     image is shifted vertically (usually 0).
 *
 * <b>Note</b><br>
 * If the face style is <tt>FaceStyle.CARD_AND_MARKER</tt>, then you must
 * also define a clip region for the portrait as it is drawn on the marker,
 * and you may define scale and pan values for the default portrait image.
 * These keys use the same names as above, but replacing <i>portrait</i>
 * with <i>marker</i>. (The marker will use the same portrait image
 * as the card, but it will have its own scale and position.)
 *
 * <b>DIY.portraitBackgroundFilled</b> (default: <tt>true</tt>)</b><br>
 * If <tt>true</tt>, the portrait clip region will be filled in with solid
 * white before painting the portrait. This is usually set when the user is
 * expected to use portraits that have transparency, for example, if there is
 * a standard graphic that should appear behind the portrait image.
 *
 * <b>DIY.portraitScaleUsesMinimum</b> (default: <tt>false</tt>)</b><br>
 * This flag changes how the defualt scale is selected when the user chooses
 * a new portrait image. Normally, a portrait is scaled so that the
 * card's portrait clip region is just barely completely covered, so that no
 * background shows through. When this flag is set to <tt>true</tt>, the portrait
 * is scaled so that the entire image is just contained within the clip region.
 * This is useful when there is one standard background shared by all components
 * and the portraits themselves are a transparent "cut-out" that will be drawn over
 * this standard background.
 *
 * <b>DIY.portraitClipping</b> (default: <tt>true</tt>)</b><br>
 * If set to <tt>true</tt> (the default), then the portrait will be clipped to
 * the portrait clipping region: any part of the portrait that falls outside
 * of the clip region will not be drawn. When set to <tt>false</tt>, the
 * portrait clip region will only be used to determine the initial scale of a
 * portrait.
 *
 * <b>Note</b><br>
 * If the face style is <tt>FaceStyle.CARD_AND_MARKER</tt>, then you can also
 * control the background fill, default scaling method, and clipping for the
 * portrait when drawn on the marker using the same properties as above
 * but substituting <i>marker</i> for <i>portrait</i> in the property name.
 *
 * <b>DIY.customPortraitHandling</b> (default: <tt>false</tt>)<br>
 * If this is <tt>true</tt>, then the simplified portrait handling described above
 * will not be used. Instead, the DIY script must provide its own implementation
 * of the <tt>PortraitProvider</tt> interface (by implementing
 * the functions <tt>getPortraitCount</tt> and <tt>getPortrait( index )</tt>).
 * This allows you to create components with more complex portrait needs, such as
 * portraits that allow rotation, multiple portraits, or linked portraits
 * (a portrait that shares an image with another portrait, but has its own
 * pan and scale values, like the marker for a <tt>CARD_AND_MARKER</tt> component).
 *
 * If you wish to use custom portrait handling, then the methods for controlling
 * clipping, filling, and default scale will have no effect. However, you can
 * use the class <tt>DefaultPortriat</tt> to implement your custom portraits, which
 * provides analogous functionality.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> When this is <tt>true</tt>, reading the <tt>portraitKey</tt>
 * will return <tt>null</tt> and attempting to change it to anything other than
 * <tt>null</tt> will result in an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt> being thrown.
 *
 * <b>DIY.transparentFaces</b> (default: <tt>false</tt>)</b><br>
 * This flag indicates that the face(s) of this card may contain transparent
 * and/or translucent pixels. This can be used to create faces with shaped
 * edges or holes. This flag should only be set when needed as transparent
 * faces require more processor and memory resources than opaque cards.
 *
 * <b>DIY.variableSizedFaces</b> (default: <tt>false</tt>)</b><br>
 * This flag indicates that the component may vary in size depending on its
 * content. The template image must be the maximum size that the card can
 * grow to. The final size of the face will be determined after it is painted by
 * cropping off any edges that are completely transparent (i.e., have an alpha value
 * of 0). Setting this flag to <tt>true</tt> automatically sets
 * <tt>DIY.transparentFaces</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.
 *
 * <b>DIY.deckSnappingHint</b> (default: <tt>DeckSnappingHint.CARD</tt>)</b><br>
 * This setting controls how this component will initially snap to other components
 * when it is in a deck. The possible values are:
 *
 * DeckSnappingHint.CARD : This is a card; it will have crop marks and snap ...
 *     to other cards and the page grid.
 * DeckSnappingHint.TILE : This is a tile (a basic building block for an ...
 *     expansion board). It will not have crop marks and it will snap to ...
 *     other tiles and the page grid.
 * DeckSnappingHint.OVERLAY : This component is overlaid over other ...
 *     components (usually tiles). Overlays do not snap to other components ...
 *     or the page grid and do not have crop marks.
 * DeckSnappingHint.INLAY : This is an inlay. Inlays snap to other inlays, ...
 *     tiles and the page grid, but when they snap to objects other than ...
 *     inlays they snap to the <i>inside</i> rather than the outside of the ...
 *     snapping edge.
 * DeckSnappingHint.OTHER : Objects with this hint snap only to other ...
 *     objects with this hint. They are not given crop marks.
 *
 * <b>DIY.bleedMargin</b> (default: 0)<br>
 * This indicates the size of an optional margin around the edges of a component
 * that is to be used as a bleed margin. A bleed margin is an area where the
 * graphics of a card continue outside of the normal boundary of the card.
 * This allows for imprecision when the card is cut by machine. If the machine
 * is misaligned by a small amount, the card content will be slightly off center but
 * it won't have a blank area along the edge(s) that would make the misalignment
 * obvious. When a margin value is set, the crop marks produced by the deck editor
 * are automatically adjusted accordingly.
 *
 * If a bleed margin is set, the same value is used on all four sides.
 * The size of the margin is measured in points (pt) and cannot be negative.
 * Typical bleed margin sizes in the publishing industry are 3 mm (8.5 pt)
 * or 1/8" (9 pt).
 *
 * Setting the margin value does not change the underlying graphics. You must
 * design your template image with a bleed margin in mind, adding pixels equal to
 * twice the margin size to both the width and height, and centering the "real"
 * card template in the larger space.
 * For example, if your template image is 150 DPI and you wish to include a
 * 9 pt margin, you must add:<br>
 * 150 pixels/in / 72 pt/in * 9 pt * 2 sides = 38 pixels (after rounding up)
 *
 * <b>DIY.highResolutionSubstitutionMode</b> (default: enabled)<br>
 * This controls whether high resolution image substitution is enabled.
 * When enabled, methods defined in <tt>DIYSheet</tt> that paint images
 * will automatically check for a copy of the image key that ends with
 * <tt>-hires</tt>. If that key exists, then that image will be substituted
 * when the card is being printed or exported at a resolution higher than
 * that of the card's template image. For example, suppose we provide the
 * following keys for a card's front template image:
 * <pre>
 * my-card-front-template = mycard/front-150.jp2
 * my-card-front-dpi = 150
 * my-card-front-template-hires = mycard/front-300.jp2
 * </pre>
 * Then when the card is printed or exported at more than 150 DPI, the
 * alternate template image will be substituted by
 * <tt>DIYSheet.paintTemplateImage</tt>.
 *
 * Changing this property allows you to force substitution on or off.
 * It is normally only changed for debugging purposes.
 * Unlike other properties listed here, this can be changed at any time.
 * The possible values are:
 *
 * HighResolutionMode.DISABLE : do not allow substitution
 * HighResolutionMode.ENABLE : allow substitution using the normal rules
 * HighResolutionMode.FORCE : always substitute if possible
 *
 * <b>DIY.setCustomFoldMarks( faceIndex, foldMarkVectors )</b> (default: none)<br>
 * Defines custom fold marks for a card face. These will be drawn with the face
 * when it is added to a deck.
 * The <tt>faceIndex</tt> defines the card face (0=front, 1=back) to add marks
 * for, although usually such a card would only have a front side.
 * The array <tt>foldMarkVectors</tt> consists of one or more pairs of points
 * (four numbers in sequence) in the order (px,py),(dx,dy). The point (px,py)
 * indicates the location of the start of the fold mark
 * (assuming that the distance from the card to the fold mark is 0).
 * The point is measured realtive to the width and height of the card.
 * For example, (0.5, 0.0) is located at the middle of the top edge of the card.
 * The point (dx,dy) is a unit vector that indicates the direction of the
 * mark. For example, the unit vector (0,-1) points straight up.
 * </div>

/**
 * createInterface( diy, editor )
 * This function is called when the component is installed in an editor.
 * It allows you to build an interface to edit your component with, and

/**
 * DIYSheet [class]
 * This is the class of all objects that are passed to a DIY card using the
 * <tt>sheet</tt> argument. You do not create <tt>DIYSheets</tt> yourself;
 * this is handled automatically. For a complete description, see the
 * <a href='javadoc:ca/cgjennings/apps/arkham/diy/DIYSheet'>DIYSheet class documentation</a>.
 * The following list is a summary of commonly used properties and methods
 * available through sheet objects:
 */

/**
 * DIYSheet.applyQualityHints( g )
 * This method can be called from a painting function to initialize a
 * graphics context in a standardized way based on the current rendering target
 * and quality. For example, it may enable high quality image interpolation
 * when exporting a card.
 * You do not need to call this for the graphics context that is passed to
 * your painting function, as it will already be initialized unless the
 * advanced feature <code>DIY.OPT_NO_QUALITY_INIT</code> is set.
 * However, it is useful if you need to create other graphics contents,
 * for example, if you create a draw on a temporary image.
 *
 * g : the graphics context to initialize
 */

/**
 * DIYSheet.templateResolution
 * The base resolution of the face. If no resolution key was set for the template
 * image, this will be 150 pixels per inch (approximately 59 pixels per cm).
 * The physical size (in inches) of the face is equal to the width and height of the
 * template image (in pixels) divided by the resolution. (If the face is
 * transparent, the size is determined <i>after</i> trimming transparent edges.)
 */

/**
 * DIYSheet.paintingResolution
 * The resolution that the sheet is set to render at, as opposed to the
 * "natural" resolution of the template image that was set when the DIY
 * was created. For example, if the user is exporting the card at 300 ppi,
 * then this will be 300.
 */

/**
 * DIYSheet.highResolutionRendering
 * This property is <tt>true</tt> if high resolution substitution is active.
 * The value is only guaranteed to be accurate when called from
 * <tt>paintFront</tt> or <tt>paintBack</tt>.
 */

/**
 * DIYSheet.paintImage( g, imageKey, x, y )
 * Paints an image at its normal size at the specified location.
 * This method will perform automatic high resolution image substitution
 * if there is a key with same name as <code>key</code> but with
 * <code>"-hires"</code> appended.
 *
 * g : the graphics context to use for painting
 * imageKey : the settings key of the image
 * x : the horizontal offset from the left side of the template image

 * <tt>"-region"</tt> to the shared key name.
 * This method will perform automatic high resolution image
 * substitution if there is a key with same name as <code>sharedKey</code> but with

/**
 * DIYSheet.drawTitle( g, text, region, font, size, alignment )
 * Draws a string within the specified region. This can be used to draw
 * fixed titles. (Unlike a markup box, it does not process any tags.)

/**
 * DIYSheet.drawOutlinedTitle( g, text, region, font, maxSize, outlineSize, textColor, outlineColor, alignment, outlineUnderneath )
 * Draws a string within the specified region. This is similar to
 * <tt>fitTitle</tt>, but each glyph (character) will be outlined in another colour.
 * The text will be centered vertically and will be aligned
 * horizontally according to the value of <tt>alignment</tt>.

 * <tt>DIYSheet.ROTATE_NONE</tt>, <tt>DIYSheet.ROTATE_LEFT</tt>,
 * <tt>DIYSheet.ROTATE_RIGHT</tt>, and <tt>DIYSheet.ROTATE_UPSIDE_DOWN</tt>
 * may also be used to specify an orientation.
 * The text is drawn as a single line and it does not interpret markup tags.
 * The interpretation of alignment is rotated along with the text.
 * For example, if the text is rotated left, then a left alignment will
 * align the text to the bottom of the region.
