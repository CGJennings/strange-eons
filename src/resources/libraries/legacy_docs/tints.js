/**
 * Support for creating tintable game components.
 * Tintable components provide an easy way for users to introduce new
 * variants of basic designs. Tintable components provide one or more
 * <i>tint panels</i>, controls that allow the user to select a colour.
 * The colour(s) selected are then used to recolour selected parts of
 * a component design. For example, it might be applied to a decorative
 * border running around the outside. This library provides the image
 * processing tools needed to apply tinting options to graphics while
 * painting a game component; the <a href='scriptdoc:uicontrols'>uicontrols</a>
 * and <a href='scriptdoc:uibindings'>uibindings</a> libraries provide the
 * controls and logic needed to support tinting on the user interface side.
 *
 * Tinting modified the original image by adusting its <i>hue</i>,
 * <i>saturation</i>, and <i>brightness</i>.  Hue refers to the colour
 * of the image pixels. The change in hue is expressed as an anglular distance
 * around a colour wheel. (So, shifting the hue by 180 degrees would change
 * the colour to its complementary colour, on the opposite side of the colour
 * wheel.) Saturation describes the purity of the image pixels. The lower the saturation,
 * the more grayish and washed out the colour appears. A saturation of 0
 * results in a shade of grey; a saturation of 1 results in the purest possible
 * expression of the hue. The saturation adjustment for tinting
 * is expressed as a scaling factor, a multiplier that is applied to the original
 * value. Brightness describes how light or dark the image appears. A brightness
 * of 0 results in a completely black image. A brightness of 1 results in the
 * brightest possible colour within the limitations of the hue and saturation.
 * Like saturation, the brightness adjustment for tinting is expressed as a
 * scaling factor.

/**
 * TintingFilter [interface]
 * This interface is implemented by all image filters that can be used with a
 * <tt>TintCache</tt> (see below). For details about this interface, refer
 * to its <a href='javadoc:ca/cgjennings/graphics/filters/TintingFilter'>API
 * documentation</a>.

const TintingFilter = ca.cgjennings.graphics.filters.TintingFilter;

/**
 * TintFilter() : AbstractTintingFilter [ctor]
 * This filter shifts the hue angle and scales the saturation and brightness
 * of every pixel in an image. The image's alpha (opacity)
 * channel is not affected, so translucent areas remain translucent.
 *
 * The hue angle is measured using a scale in which 1 is equal to 360 degrees
 * (a full circle). Values will normally range from -0.5 to +0.5 (-180 to
 * +180 degrees), but values outside of this range are acceptable.
 * A value of 0 leaves the original hue unchanged.
 *
 * The saturation and brightness values are factors multiplied against the
 * saturation and brightness of the source pixel. Factors less than 0 are treated
 * as 0. Factors may be more than 1 (100%). If the scaled value for a given
 * pixel is more than 1, it is clamped at 1 in the result.
 *
 * If using an <tt>HSBPanel</tt>, it will always provide a hue between -0.5 and +0.5,
 * and saturation and brightness values between 0 and 1. Depending on the
 * saturation and brightness of the source image, you may wish to scale those
 * values up or down before passing them to the <tt>TintCache</tt>.
 * Otherwise, using the panel it will only be possible to <i>decrease</i>
 * the brightness and saturation (or keep it the same).
 * For example, if you wanted the maximum brightness scale to be 1.2 (120%),
 * multiply the value returned from the <tt>HSBPanel</tt> by 1.2. When choosing
 * the default brightness, use 1/1.2 if you want the default settings to
 * work out to the original image (1/1.2 * 1.2 = 1).
 *
 * For convenience, the class <tt>TintFilter.ScaledTintFilter</tt> can perform
 * scaling for you:
 * <pre>
 * // scale saturation to 120%, brightness to 200%
 * var f = new TintFilter.ScaledTintFilter( h, s, b, 1.2, 2.0 );
 * </pre>
 * A <tt>ScaledTintFilter</tt> gets and sets factors between 0 and 1 as usual,
 * but internally applies the requested scaling factors.

/**
 * ReplaceFilter() [ctor]
 * This filter replaces the hue and saturation, and scales the brightness,
 * of the pixels in the source image.
 * This filter can be used to tint a greyscale (black and white) source
 * image. Depending on the brightness of the source image, you may wish to
 * scale the brightness value passed to the filter up in order to cover a
 * wider range of possible tints. (For example, if the average brightness
 * of the source image is 50%, you might scale the brightness value by 2.)

/**
 * Tintable
 * <tt>Tintable</tt> is a Java interface that is implemented by objects
 * that can act as models for an <tt>HSBPanel</tt>. Panels read their
 * initial settings by calling the <tt>Tintable</tt>'s <tt>getTint</tt>
 * method, and call its <tt>setTint</tt> method when the tint controls
 * are adjusted. By implementing the <tt>Tintable</tt> interface you
 * can process messages from the control panel yourself.
 * Normally, however, you do not need to implement this interface.
 * A standard implementation is provided through the
 * <tt><a href="uibindings.html">uibindings</a></tt>
 * library that can read and write tints to a private setting on a component.

/**
 * TintCache( filter ) [ctor]
 * A <tt>TintCache</tt> improves drawing performance when working with
 * tints. It takes advantage of the fact that the base image to be tinted
 * doesn't usually change between draws, and that the user only rarely
 * adjusts the tint compared to other editing operations. Instead of applying
 * a tint filter to draw the tinted graphic each time the card is redrawn,
 * you can create a cache, set the filter and base image to use, and then
 * request the tinted version of the image as needed. The cache object
 * will keep a tinted copy of the image available, and update it as needed
 * when the selected tint changes.
 *
 * To create a new tint cache, you must pass in a new instance of
 * the tinting filter class that you wish to use (typically
 * an instance of <tt>TintFilter</tt>).
 *
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 * // during setup:
 * var frontTinter = new TintCache( new TintFilter() );
 * frontTinter.setImage( frontImage );
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * // during drawing:
 * frontTinter.setFactors( hueShift, saturationScale, brightnessScale );
 * var tintedImage = frontTinter.getTintedImage();
 * </pre>

 /**
  * TintCache.setFactors( hue, saturation, brightness )
  * Set the HSB tinting factors to use when tinting the source image.
  * hue : the hue adjustment; the exact effect depends on the filter used
  * saturation : the saturation adjustment; the exact effect depends on the filter used
  * brightness : the brightness adjustment; the exact effect depends on the filter used
  */

 /**
  * TintCache.getTintedImage()
  * Returns a tinted image that is created by applying the tinting filter used to
  * construct this cache to the current source image, using the current HSB factors.
  * If the image and factors have not changed since the last call, this may return
  * a cached result.
  *
  * If the current source image data has been modified by writing
  * to the image (for example, if you used as the destination image for some other
  * filtering operation), then you should force any cached result to be cleared before
  * calling this method. An example:
  * <pre>
  * var tc = new TintCache( new TintFilter() );
  * tc.setFactors( -0.25, 1, 0.8 );
  * tc.setImage( source );
  *
  * // ...
  *
  * var tinted = TintCache.getTintedImage();
  *
  * var g = source.createGraphics();
  * try {
  *     // ...
  *     // modify the pixels in "source"
  *     // ...
  * } finally {
  *     g.dispose();
  * }
  *
  * // force clearing cached results before getting tinted version
  * // of the modified source image:
  * tc.setImage( null );
  * tc.setImage( source );
  * tinted = TintCache.getTintedImage();
  * </pre>
  *
  * returns a tinted version of the source image
