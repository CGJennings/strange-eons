/**
 * Helper functions that simplifys using <tt>PluginContext.getModifiers()</tt>

/**
 * Global Variables
 * The library defines several constants to represent the different modifier keys.
 * Modifiers are encoded as bit masks: to represent multiple keys, take their
 * logical OR. For example, Control and Shift together is represented by the expression
 * <tt>CONTROL|SHIFT</tt>.
 *
 * SHIFT : represents the Shift key
 * CONTROL : represents the Control key
 * CTRL : same as <tt>CONTROL</tt> (different platforms use different spellings)
 * ALT : represents the Alt key
 * META : represents the Meta key found on some *NIX systems
 * COMMAND : represents the Command key under OS X (the same value as <tt>META</tt>)
 * MENU : represents the key used for menu accelerators on this platform (Control on Windows, Command on OS X)
