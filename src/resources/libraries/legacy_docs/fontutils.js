 * separated by commas, and this function returns the first available entry.
 * For example, <tt>FontUtils.findMatchingFamily( "Bookman Old
 * Style,Times" )</tt> would return <tt>Bookman Old Style</tt> if that family
 * was available. If not then it would return <tt>Times</tt> if that family was available.
 * If none of the typefaces in <tt>families</tt> is available, then <tt>defaultFamily</tt>
 * is returned (which may be <tt>null</tt>).
 *
 * families : a string listing candidate families
 * defaultFamily : an optional default to use if no family matches ...
 *     (may be <tt>null</tt>; if not specified will use the default body family)

 * entry if they do not include a '/' character. For example, the following
 * list would load a family of two fonts located in the <tt>foo/fonts</tt>
 * resource folder: <tt>foot/fonts/bar_regular.ttf, bar_italic.ttf</tt>.
 *
 * Supported font formats include TrueType (<tt>.ttf</tt>), OpenType (<tt>.otf</tt>),
 * and PostScript Type 1 fonts.
 * The file extension used for the resource file name must be correct
 * for the format of the font resource, or font creation will fail.
