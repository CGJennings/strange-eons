/**
 * Convert this Plug-in into an Extension
 * When this library is included in a plug-in script, the script becomes
 * an extension. (It must still be packaged as a </tt>.seext</tt> bundle
 * to be discovered and loaded at the correct time.)
 *
 * This library defines a <tt>getPluginType()</tt> function that returns the
 * correct type for extensions and imports the following classes from the
 * <tt>gamedata</tt> package into the global namespace:
 * <pre>
 * Game
 * Expansion
 * ClassMap
 * ExpansionSymbolTemplate
 * AbstractExpansionSymbolTemplate
 * SymbolVariantUtilities
 * TileSet
 * Silhouette
 * </pre>
 *
 * <b>Notes:</b> Extensions are loaded and executed before the program is
 * fully initialized. The variables <tt>Editor</tt> and
 * <tt>Component</tt> will be <tt>null</tt>. However, a valid
 * <tt>PluginContext</tt> object is provided. Extensions are never "activated"
 * by the user, so they do not require or use a <tt>run()</tt> function.
