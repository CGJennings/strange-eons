/**
 * Utility methods for converting plug-in bundles to and from published catalog
 * bundles (such as ".pbz" files). A published bundle is the network transport
 * format used to transmit plug-in bundles from a remote catalog server to
 * Strange Eons.
 *
 * <p>
 * A published bundle compresses an existing bundle with a high-efficiency
 * compression method. For best results, the existing bundle should first
 * be re-packed so that the underlying ZIP/JAR does not compress any entries
 * (i.e. all entries are written with {@code STORE}). This will reduce the
 * overall file size compared to compressing an already compressed bundle.
 * (The project command to publish a bundle performs this step automatically.)
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Previously, a two-process was used in which the original
 * bundle (a type of JAR file) was compressed with Pack200, then the result
 * compressed as described above. However, support for Pack200 was removed
 * from Java. As the required tools are no longer distributed with JREs
 * starting in Java 14, bundles published with older versions of the app
 * can no longer be decompressed by newer versions of the app. (They can
 * be unpacked by an older version, then the bundle installed in the newer
 * version.)
